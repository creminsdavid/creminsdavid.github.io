    <h2>
      Rock ‘n Roll
    </h2>
    <p>
      Learning the guitar (thanks, Dad) in middle school led to writing songs, musical
      experiments for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DaveCamz">class projects</a>,
      picking up the bass, and joining a band my freshman year of high school.
      I have been in a band (or two) and seeking chances to perform - whether in
      small, crowded rooms or amazing venues like Fitzgeralds or the House of Blues
      in Houston - ever since. I have spent countless hours in my room recording
      in some form, by a rough estimate, over one hundred original songs. Oh, Nostalgia
      (myself, Tib Stovall, Paul Howie, and Vernon McGhee) even got into recording
      studios a few times to lay down our "hits", <a href="content/music/lb.html">Little Birdie</a>
      in 2011 and <a href="content/music/spots.html">Bright Spots</a> in 2013.
      Tib and I additionally recorded demos of all the songs we wrote together
      throughout high school before graduation, <a href="content/music/on.html">It Goes On </a>
      (2014) being one of our old favorites.

    <h2>
      Rock ‘n Roll Continued
    </h2>
    <p>
      If anything, college has given me even more chances to explore music. I am
      one of the co-presidents of our schools' Musicians' Coalition, a job where
      the bureaucratic necessities are made worthwhile by getting to spend Pomona's
      money on amps, mics, and instruments. It has also led to some great bandmates
      who have appeared in different combinations in a group we call Sans Gabriel
      (a reference to our dear local mountains). We have played around the campuses
      including in a concert series we started in Doms Lounge, from which we have
      video of the original group playing our original <a href="https://youtu.be/6lnSckffcrk">Maze</a>
      and covering <a href="https://youtu.be/JglfTS3qnvo">Trojans</a> in 2015.
      From 2016, here is another version of the band playing <a href="https://youtu.be/ee8jry4zAAU">Wondering</a>.
      Isaac Harris and I also recorded rough demos of some of our songs, including
      <a href="content/music/clear.html">Clear</a> which was written with
      Adam Revello at his house over Thanksgiving break of 2015.

    <h2>
      Orchestra
    </h2>
    <p>
      I still vividly remember the afternoon in 2cd grade I came home with a pink slip
      from music class asking if we wanted to enroll in the Bunker Hill Fiddling Lions
      program – I had some friends already doing it, so what the hell I thought (or some
      2cd grade equivalent of that). Nothing has been the same since. Although I have
      continued playing in college, probably the height of my orchestral career came
      in senior year of high school when my orchestra travelled to New York City to
      play in the famed Carnegie Hall. I got my three note solo there and was part
      of the string octet you can hear featured in this beautiful, lush piece recorded
      in the Main Hall in 2014, <a href="content/music/canning.html">Fantasy on a Hymn</a>
      by Thomas Canning. And here is me playing the first movement of the
      <a href="content/music/brahms.html">Brahms Violin Concerto in G Major</a>
      with my pianist friend Sophia Sun at Pomona in 2015.

      Music in College
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between keeping up with the violin, the band, and trying to learn some proper
      piano, I have also been very lucky to be a part of two very unique collegiate
      music group: Midnight Echo a cappella and Mariachi Serrano de Claremont.
      Echo especially performs regularly around the Claremont Colleges, from
      small but well-attended snack concerts to sellout showcases with other
      a cappella groups <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TnrN7Rf12g">in Big Bridges</a>
      Hall of Music. I also still getting work as a volunteer and hired as a
      private lesson tutor on the violin - here's to hoping these sorts of opportunities
      to collaborate, teach, and perform exist on into the 'real world' :D
      <br>
      I also have not given up on writing songs just for myself -
      <a href="content/music/overland.html">Overland Avenue</a> (Summer 2015)
      and
      <a href="content/music/westheimer.html">Westheimer Avenue</a> (Summer 2016)
      are two good, recent examples of how music and lyrics help me to this day
      make sense of the places, people, and changes in my life.

      "You're the music in my life"
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even at 13 (during his bar mitzvah speech, no less), my brother knew how to
      get to me with declarations like this. The truth is, though, that I have
      never been prouder than I am while watching Kieran surpass his older sibling
      in so many ways. I’m excited and impressed every time I come home and see the
      musical and personal leaps and bounds my little bro has made, and I am happy
      in thinking I may have played some role in making music such a big part of
      both of our lives. More and more recently we have been able to play together
      as well, whether he is soloing sax over my guitar or accompanying my
      violin with his piano. For their respective 'days' in 2016, we gave our
      <a href="content/music/mom.html">Dear Mom</a> and
      <a href="content/music/dad.html">Dear Dad</a> modified version of some of
      their favorite songs (with apologies to the briliant Lin Manuel Miranda
      and Michael Stipe respectively).
