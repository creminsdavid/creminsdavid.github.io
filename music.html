      Learning the guitar (thanks, Dad) led to writing songs, picking up the bass, and
      joining a band my freshman year of high school. I have been in a band (or two)
      practically ever since and by a rough estimate have recorded in some form well
      over one hundred original songs, mainly just to my computer in my room or to a
      small, crowded room, but occasionally in an actual recording studio. Here’s a
      few selections from my high school group Oh, Nostalgia (with Vernon McGhee (link),
      Paul Howie, and Tib Stovall) …

      I still vividly remember the afternoon in 2cd grade I came home with a pink slip
      from music class asking if we wanted to enroll in the Bunker Hill Fiddling Lions
      program – I had some friends already doing it, so what the hell I thought (or some
      2cd grade equivalent of that). Nothing has been the same since. Although I have
      continued playing in college, probably the height of my orchestral career came
      in senior year of high school when my orchestra travelled to New York City to
      play in the famed Carnegie Hall. I got my three note solo there and was part
      of the string octet you can hear featured in this beautiful, lush piece recorded
      in [the big room] of Carnegie by Thomas Canning…

      Between keeping up with the violin, being a president of Pomona’s Musician Coalition,
      playing in a band (Sans Gabriel) with friends, and trying to learn some proper
      piano, I have also been very lucky to be a part of two very unique collegiate
      music group: Midnight Echo a cappella (link) and Mariachi Serrano de Claremont.
      We perform…(links?)

      Even at 13 (during his bar mitzvah speech, no less), my brother knew how to
      get at me, and not always at annoyance. The
      truth is though that I have learned that the proudest a sibling can be is watching
      their younger self surpass them in every way [fix]. I’m very excited and impressed
      every time I come home and see the musical leaps and bounds my brother has made,
      and happy to think I may have played a role in making it such a big part of
      both of our lives. Here’s link(s) to collaborations we’ve done for our parent(s)
      … (apologies to Michael Stipe/Lin Manuel Miranda, two musical heroes)
