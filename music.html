      Rock ‘n Roll
    </h2>
    <p>
      Learning the guitar (thanks, Dad) in middle school led to writing songs, musical
      experiments for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DaveCamz">class projects</a>,
      picking up the bass, and joining a band my freshman year of high school.
      I have been in a band (or three) and seeking chances to perform - whether in
      small, crowded rooms or amazing venues like Fitzgeralds or the House of Blues
      in Houston - ever since. I have spent countless hours in my room writing and recording songs.
      Oh, Nostalgia (myself, Tib Stovall, Paul Howie, and Vernon McGhee) even got into recording
      studios a few times to lay down our "hits", <a href="content/music/lb.html">Little Birdie</a>
      in 2011 and <a href="content/music/spots.html">Bright Spots</a> in 2013.
      Tib and I additionally recorded demos of all the songs we wrote together
      throughout high school before graduation, <a href="content/music/on.html">It Goes On </a>
      (2014) being one of our old favorites - the rest + more are in the SoundCloud link above!

      Rock ‘n Roll Continued
    </h2>
    <p>
      If anything, college gave me even more chances to explore music. I was
      one of the co-presidents of our schools' Musicians' Coalition, a job where
      the bureaucratic necessities were made worthwhile by getting to spend Pomona's
      money on amps, mics, and instruments. It has also led to some great bandmates
      who I played with in different combinations in groups called Sans Gabriel
      (a reference to our dear local mountains) and Moms After Dark (a reference
      to our dear nocturnal mothers). We played all around the 5 campuses, some
      footage from which I have put on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Jb9LHT8Ytw_QWLkp7GjzA?view_as=subscriber">YouTube</a>
      page.

      Orchestra
    </h2>
    <p>
      I still vividly remember the afternoon in 2cd grade I came home with a pink slip
      from music class asking if we wanted to enroll in the Bunker Hill Fiddling Lions
      program – I had some friends already doing it, so what the hell I thought (or some
      2cd grade equivalent of that). Nothing has been the same since. Although I have
      continued playing in college, probably the height of my orchestral career came
      in senior year of high school when my orchestra travelled to New York City to
      play in the famed Carnegie Hall. I got my three note solo there and was part
      of the string octet you can hear featured in this beautiful, lush piece recorded
      in the Main Hall in 2014, <a href="content/music/canning.html">Fantasy on a Hymn</a>
      by Thomas Canning. And here is me playing the first movement of the
      <a href="content/music/brahms.html">Brahms Violin Concerto in G Major</a>
      with my pianist friend Sophia Sun at Pomona in 2015.

      Music in College
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between keeping up with the violin, the bands, teaching lessons, and trying to learn some proper
      piano, I was also very lucky to be a part of some amazing collegiate
      music groups: Midnight Echo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TnrN7Rf12g">a cappella</a>,
      Mariachi Serrano de Claremont, and the Claremont Colleges Irish Music Ensemble.
      I really will miss all the amazing musicians and musical opportunities I had
      at the 5Cs and hope to find some version of them in the 'real world'.

      "You're the music in my life"
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even at 13 (during his Bar Mitzvah speech, no less), my brother knew how to
      get to me with declarations like this. The truth is, though, that I have
      never been prouder than I am while watching Kieran surpass his older sibling
      in so many ways. I’m excited and impressed every time I come home and see the
      musical and personal leaps and bounds my little bro has made, and I am happy
      in thinking I may have played some role in making music such a big part of
      both of our lives. He's going to the San Francisco Conservatory of Music to study
      Composition! I suppose we both owe it all to our 'Dear <a href="content/music/mom.html"> Mom</a> and
      <a href="content/music/dad.html">Dad</a>' though (with apologies to the briliant Lin Manuel Miranda
      and Michael Stipe respectively).
