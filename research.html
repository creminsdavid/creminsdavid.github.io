      I grew up steeped in the humanities, definitely for the better, but I think
      I have known from a young age that I intended to either explore the very large
      – stars, planets, and otherwise – or the very small – chemicals, neurons,
      and ‘otherwise’. While I am deeply fascinated with and care immensely
      about what lies in the middle (human affairs, history, the people around me),
      I am still a firm believer that society benefits greatly from basic science
      research of all varieties. Some of the most inspiring, compassionate,
      intelligent, and humanistic people I have met have been in laboratories,
      and I do not think this is a coincidence. I have the privilege to be in
      a position in life to dedicate myself to study of the brain and mind,
      and in light of this I am both grateful and determined.

      It did not take me long in college to realize that today the design,
      data acquisition, and analysis of most experiments is computation-driven,
      so I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science alongside my first major of
      Cognitive Science. With applications ranging from AI to fMRI,
      I view the challenge and intellectual excitement of my math and
      computer education to be key to the future.

      My current academic and professional goals are to work in private industry
      for some time improving my analytical, computational, and communication
      skills before returning to higher education in pursuit of a post-graduate
      degree in the cognitive neurosciences.

      I am eternally indebted to the friendship, guidance, connections, rigor,
      and passion of my Pomona College advisor and mentor
      <a href ="https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/deborah-m-burke">
      Dr. Deborah Burke</a>.
      <br>
      <b>Research Skills:</b> Python, Matlab, R, SPSS, Freesurfer MRI analysis,
      Mango DTI analysis, TMS design, EPrime, CITI and NIH human subject safety
      certified, experimental scripting

  <h3>Dr. Martin Monti's University of California, Los Angeles
    <a href="https://montilab.psych.ucla.edu/"> MontiLab</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    During the summer of 2015, after my first year of college, I was awarded
    funds by Pomona College's Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) to work
    as a research assistant at UCLA. In Dr. Monti's lab, I learned a lot while living
    alone in a city for the first time, reading and reviewing articles, participating
    in lab meetings, helping PhD candidate Micah Johnson with the experimental
    design for his TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation)-based thesis project,
    especially with the creation of tasks in the cognitive domains of music processing
    and action planning. While there, I was also recruited by researchers in
    Dr. Jesse Rissman's <a href="http://rissmanlab.psych.ucla.edu/rissmanlab/Home.html">
     Memory Lab</a> to help run participants for an fMRI study
    (<a href="https://philoneuro.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/reggente_et_al_cns_final.pdf">
    poster</a>). I earned pocket money by participating in various imaging studies
    (see my brain at the top right!), and presented an overview of some of my
    work for the summer at the annual Pomona College <a href="content/research/postercremins.pdf">
    Poster Fair</a>.

  <h3>Dr. Arturo Hernandez's University of Houston
    <a href="http://www.uh.edu/class/psychology/dev-psych/research/bilingualism/">
      Laboratory for the Neural Bases of Bilingualism</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    During the summer of 2016, I was awarded another SURP to do a summer fellowship
    in Dr. Hernandez's lab under the supervision of postdoc
    <a href="http://www.uh.edu/class/psychology/dev-psych/research/bilingualism/people/archila-suerte/">
     Dr. Pilar Archila-Suerte</a>. While self-teaching myself R (and making
     this website), my main responsibilities were to edit and analyze structural
     brain scans using primarily <a href="http://www.freesurfer.net">Freesurfer</a>
     tools, editing and creating Matlab scripts for in-progress experiments, and
     designing/coding a cognitive control experiment for bilinguals and monolinguals
     (using Python/<a href="http://www.expyriment.org/">Expyriment</a>).
