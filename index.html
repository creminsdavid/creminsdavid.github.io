        Summer 2017!

      <!-- original:
      What an interesting project to undertake, attempting to encapsulate
      myself in a webpage. I am woefully ill prepared for this task, yet I
      intend to have something I'm proud of to present to friends, family,
      and strangers alike by 2017. Thankfully, what I currently lack in coding
      skills I make up for in a desire to challenge myself - a healthy dose
      of narcissism (or a love for self-expression, if you're feeling generous)
      doesn't hurt, either. Here's to hoping someone someday will take interest
      in scrolling through these past, present, and future projects of mine!
      BA version:
      I'm currently exploring Argentina, studying at the University of Buenos Aires,
      Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, interning at the Argentine Fulbright Commission,
      not working enough on my
      <a href="https://github.com/creminsdavid/creminsdavid.github.io">
      Github </a>, thinking a lot about life, trying to learn another language, missing
      home, and loving every day here. When I left I originally intended to
      <a href="https://lostinmigration.wordpress.com/"> blog </a>, but I've instead
      decided to write more just for myself here. However, here are my current
      goals posted up in my room (Muñiz 283 5B; Buenos Aires 1212) here:
      </br>
      1. Comer bien y hacer ejercicios cada día
      </br>
      2. Hacer mi trabajo bien
      </br>
      3. Pensar en el futuro
      </br>
      4. Comunicar con todo mi mundo
      </br>
      5. Tener todas las experiencias posibles
      </br>
      </br>
      P.S. This page has been getting a surprising amount of traffic from the UK.
      I imagine that is because there is a David Cremins who lives there also active
      online. If that is you, congrats on the name! But I really disagree with your
      politics.

      After a 2016 that took me around the globe and back again a few times, I am
      very much enjoying being back home in Texas for a few weeks before driving
      back out to California. I expect my junior spring semester to be filled with
      wonderful reunions, new academic and work challenges, and hopefully enough
      off-campus adventure. In the summer I will be interning for 12 weeks with
      Workday in Mountain View, south of SF, and then back down south to start
      senior year! Whatever stresses and unexpected changes may come, my love and
      gratitude for everyone I have been surrounded with in the last year and the
      amazing strangers I have yet to meet :)
      <br>
      My 'resolutions' are to listen to more music and less podcasts, not scroll
      down the FB newsfeed more than once a day, take advantage of having a car
      in SoCal more, smile fully at people I pass by, to work out more routinely,
      and to appreciate more the small wonders and privilieges of my time alive.

      Home from Argentina and (amazingly) finished with junior year at Pomona already,
      I'm excited to be spending this summer as a Application Development intern
      with Workday Inc. in Pleasanton, CA!
