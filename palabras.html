      913 words. 5 months. 154 days. Nearly 6 per day, although sometimes there
      were as few as just 1 (<i>apoderar</i>, 27th of October) or as many as 18,
      morsels picked out from conversations, advertisements in the subway, classes,
      books, songs, from mere curiosity, a thousand different ways. All these
      capsulized memories, more vivid than any journal or blog, taking up every
      available line of my little blue notebook. This tattered, handmade dictionary
      chronicles it all, from my arrival in Buenos Aires on the brisk winter morning
      of the 18th of July when I learned <i>morder</i>  and <i>correa</i> as I
      walked Banda for the first time until the ends of hot December when I picked
      up on the word <i>represa</i> from a museum exhibit sign. In between, the
      pages of scrawled black ink speak to me, not a week removed from my time in
      Argentina, of months and friends and places forever close to me and already
      far away.
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Mandarina</i> and <i>desabrigado</i> are for when I could barely
      understand the cashier at the <i>frutería</i> and foolhardily thought I
      could explore the city in just a t-shirt. <i>Bárbaro, asado</i> and
      <i>buena onda</i> call up dozens of nights amongst the <i>porteños</i>
      and my fellow exchange students, with too much Quilmes and not enough Malbec.
      I recall the <i>ganas</i> I had to find some peanut butter <i>bien crujiente</i>
      in Barrio Chino, my first bitter sip from the <i>bombilla</i>, and trying
      to understand Vicky, the daughter of our AirBNB hosts in Córdoba, talking
      about her favorite <i>peluche</i>. Hundreds of words, such as <i>matiz</i>
      from the 18th of August or <i>índole</i> from the 12th of September, I have
      no recollection where they came from, while others could never be mistaken
      (<i>ojo che</i> not to mix up <i>conservante y preservativo, ¿viste?</i>).

        Until you’re forced to get by on a regular basis, in the home and in the
        school, of a foreign country, it’s difficult to realize how many words
        high school vocabulary books can never cover, and so I learned <i>tomacorriente</i>
        and <i>carilla</i>, <i>baúl</i> and <i>bolsillo</i>. But then again, when
        it comes to <i>valija, frutilla, palta, anana</i>, or <i>zapatilla</i>,
        those textbooks would not have helped in Argentina anyway.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some entries in the blue dictionary are filled with sadness and pain:
        <i>pésame</i> on the 23rd of September when my Nana passed away, followed
        by <i>ataúd</i> after several days of silence while I was in Dublin. On
        the 9th of November, the day following the election, there are only two
        words written: <i>entumecido</i> and <i>facho</i>. However, these darker
        moments are swamped, at least in quantity, by memories of <i>tintineo</i>
        in Mendoza or <i>sambayón</i> in the <i>milonga</i>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reading through texts for my philosophy and history classes, and Borges
        in my ample free time, offered more than enough terms for my consumption,
        ranging from <i>libre albedrío</i> to <i>aleatorio</i>. However, the best
        education came through just paying attention to the richness of daily life,
        to the meanings I previously did not appreciate in <i>comprometer</i> or
        the basic need to refer to a <i>muelle</i> just off the <i>adoquines</i>
        while on the beaches of Uruguay.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some words are surprising in their utility: <i>destornillador</i>
        came in handy both in fixing a plumbing issue and in a bar, meanwhile
        <i>maracuyá</i> appeared in most every <i>heladería </i>and <i>feria</i>,
        and an afternoon concert in the Teatro Colón taught us that <i>araña</i>
        can also mean chandelier.
        <br>
        <br>
        While I would like to claim that I learned many great words such as
        <i>fulano</i> from my internship at Fulbright, the truth is I picked up
        more from Netflix and podcasts, ranging from <i>pepino</i> to <i>preso,
        cachorro</i> to <i>vitrina</i>. I am proud to say, though, that much of
        my most prized vocabulary came from the national religion (¡<i>vamos River!</i>):
        <i>partidario, garras, bronca, forro, yuta</i>…it is a beautiful language.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are too many words concerning food and drink to even touch on here,
        but from the <i>masas rellenas con fugazzeta</i> of Pizzería Guerrín to a
        famous <i>tira</i> cooked over the <i>brasas</i> in the countryside of
        the province with <i>luciérnagas</i> flickering above, there are already
        enough reasons to return south soon.
